# To-Do-List

This to do list project allows the user to edit various tasks within the to do list. With my partner Litzy, we used Visual Studio Code to code this project. A challenge we faced was learning how to use index.

Program instructions are found within the code.

My partner was Litzy. She gave me guidance as I entered the code. We worked really well together and were able to complete the to do list project efficiently.
